### Current progress:
- Coded up basic SINDy and weak SINDy (bump and Fourier) functions for the Lorenz system
- Ran error comparisons (error norms and true positive ratios) at different noise levels (200 tests at each noise level); data saved to `results.mat`
- Sparsity threshold tuning (does not seem to work very well)

### Working on:
- Try a different attractor to see if the "convex" persists
- Different numbers of test functions for the Fourier weak SINDy
